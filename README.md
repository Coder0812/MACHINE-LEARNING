# MACHINE LEARNING

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

# MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS
There are three types of machine learning algorithms

1) Supervised Learning
2) Unsupervised Learning
3) Reinforcement Learning

# SUPERVISED LEARNING
Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.

In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machines work as the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. It applies the same concept as a student learns in the supervision of the teacher.

Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine learning model. The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y).

In the real-world, supervised learning can be used for Risk Assessment, Image classification, Fraud Detection, spam filtering, etc.

# REGRESSION 
Regression algorithms are used if there is a relationship between the input variable and the output variable. It is used for the prediction of continuous variables, such as Weather forecasting, Market Trends, etc. Below are

Some Regression algorithms which come under supervised learning:

. Simple Linear Regression

. Multiple Linear Regression

. Linear Regression

. Decision Tree Regression

. Random Forest Regression

. Support Vector Regression (SVR)

. Polynomial Regression

# CLASSIFCATION
Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical, which means there are two classes such as Yes-No, Male-Female, True-false, etc.

Spam Filtering,

Some Classification algorithms which come under supervised learning:

. Logistic Regression

. Kneigbors Classifier (KNN)

. Naive Bayes

. Random Forest Classifier

. Decision Trees Classifier

. Support Vector Classifier

# UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
In supervised machine learning in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data. But there may be many cases in which we do not have labeled data and need to find the hidden patterns from the given dataset. So, to solve such types of cases in machine learning, we need unsupervised learning techniques.

. Clustering: Clustering is a method of grouping the objects into clusters such that objects with most similarities remains into a group and has less or no similarities with the objects of another group. Cluster analysis finds the commonalities between the data objects and categorizes them as per the presence and absence of those commonalities.

Some Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:

. K-means clustering

. Agglomerative Clustering

. DBSCAN

# REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
Reinforcement learning algorithms receive a set of instructions and guidelines and then make their own decisions about how to handle a task through a process of trial and error. Decisions are either rewarded or punished as a means of guiding the AI to the optimal solution to the problem.
